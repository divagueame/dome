            A green product is a sustainable product designed to minimize its environmental impacts during its whole life-cycle and even after it’s of no use.
            
            Green products are usually identified by having two basic goals – reducing waste and maximizing resource efficiency. They are manufactured using toxic-free ingredients and environmentally-friendly procedures and are certified by recognized organizations like Energy star, Forest Stewardship Council, etc.</p>
